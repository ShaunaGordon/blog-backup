    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Third Party Recruiters,</p>

<p>Due to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.</p>

<p>The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means <strong>you have a lot of competition</strong>. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.</p>

<p>We tech folks are generally a merit-based people. We’ll respect you if we have reason to do so. You can earn that respect by demonstrating that you respect us and what we do (and no, saying that you do doesn’t cut it; show, don’t tell). Here are some ways to do that.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Have some fundamental understanding of the technology</h2>

<p>Or, <em>don&rsquo;t play buzzword Bingo.</em></p>

<p>I don’t expect you to have been a developer, but I do expect basic, high-level knowledge, such as the fact that <strong>Java and JavaScript are two very different things.</strong> How can you expect to get proper, let alone quality, matches for the companies you’re recruiting for if you can’t even get the technology right?</p>

<h2>Pay attention to the last time I used a technology, and the ones I use now</h2>

<p>Or, <em>do some some homework.</em></p>

<p>I know there’s a certain amount of crossover when it comes to technologies, but there’s also a sort of expiration date, especially at the Senior Developer level. <strong>I have not touched Java since 2007.</strong> Odds are, I am <em>not</em> a good fit for that great Android developer position you’re looking to fill, nor will I be interested in it, nor am I likely to have anyone in my circles that use it. For the record, my network primarily covers the open source languages (PHP, Ruby, Python) and, to a lesser extent, the .Net languages. However, I won’t be forwarding your leads to them if you haven’t taken the time to build some rapport with me.</p>

<h2>Pay attention to <em>all</em> of the technologies I use</h2>

<p>My time at a design agency has resulted in a number of “front end!” development position leads, since a large portion of my job was HTML and CSS. Now, while a front end development position <em>may</em> not get immediately trashed, you will probably find a far better match with me for a <em>full stack</em> position.</p>

<p>I’ll be among the first to admit &mdash; software is a <em>huge</em> industry (really, there isn’t a word in the English language that adequately describes just how mind-boggling huge an industry it is). Front end web development is, on its own, enormous. If a company is looking for a dedicated front-end person, odds are, I don’t know half of what they’re looking for, at least not to the level that would best serve them. Now, while I’d love to learn it and would have no qualms doing so (hell, it’s how I’ve learned most of the technologies I use at this moment), odds are very good that I’m not as great a match for the company as you might think. There’s probably someone out there better suited to that particular position.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong &mdash; if the company doesn’t mind a little more time to pick up the new technology <em>and</em> the ins and outs of the new (to me) company, then by all means. However, most companies, especially those going through the heavy, active recruiting that you get paid to do, generally prefer someone who can “hit the ground running.” Angular/Backbone/Ember/Knockout may be a JavaScript framework, but it’s enough of its own beast that just knowing JavaScript probably isn’t enough for a “hit the ground running” position.</p>

<p>Instead, look at what I <em>do</em> use, and look at <em>all</em> of it, especially in recent gigs. Odds are very good that if you have a position that needs a little bit of everything, then I <em>am</em> a good fit for it. Framework matches? Even better!</p>

<h2>Write better introductions</h2>

<p>I literally received an email from a third party recruiter that started like this:</p>

<blockquote>I was just cruising around the web, and I stumbled upon what you've been up to on the software engineering front.</blockquote>


<p>Seriously? Now, I don’t expect some kind of formal thesis with the formal greetings we all learned in school, but come on. Do you really expect me to believe that you, a person whose entire job is to seek out people like me, was “cruising around the web” and <em>happened</em> to stumble on my website/Twitter/LinkedIn profile? Really, it sounds like a bad pickup line.</p>

<p>Granted, I’m sure there is a certain amount of meandering going on, following leads and connections, friends-of-friends and blog posts by related authors. It’s not like I’ve made myself scarce in the online world. If you really just happened upon my information, then cool, I’ve done my job at least to some extent.</p>

<p>But please don’t fluff it up like the above quote. Something like “I found your LinkedIn profile” or “saw one of your blog posts mentioned in a Tweet on my feed,” or whatever other more straightforward and non-sickening way of telling me where you found my information is much less likely to get your email immediately deleted. You also get some brownie points for being more specific with how you’ve found me.</p>

<h2>For that matter, introduce yourself</h2>

<p>If you send me a LinkedIn invite, and all it reads is the &ldquo;Join my LinkedIn network&rdquo; canned pre-fill text, then your invite will get trashed. I don&rsquo;t collect contacts, especially third party recruiters.</p>

<h2>Be more straightforward in general</h2>

<p>I hate social games. I value straightforwardness and despise things like this:</p>

<blockquote> I came across your profile on LinkedIn while researching Developer professionals. Your background/experience caught my eye so I’m sending you a quick note to see if you'd be able to point me in the right direction. 
 
Our client is looking for a Web Developer in the Columbus, OH area! Do you know of anyone who may be interested?</blockquote>


<p>Especially when it’s followed by this, when I ask for more information:</p>

<blockquote>I wanted to see if you were still interested in this opportunity! We sat down with the client this week and were able to find out a ton more details of exactly what they are looking for, I would love to talk some details with you!</blockquote>


<p>Now, I understand that, as a third party, you can’t (or are hesitant to) disclose things like the company name (though doing so would earn you some brownie points; otherwise, it conveys the message that you don’t trust me, and that’s not a good start), but if you don’t want your email to end up in the trash bin, then give me at least some information about the job itself &mdash; things like what technologies, number of years experience. You know, the usual.</p>

<p>This also highlights another issue.</p>

<h2>Don’t insist on only talking to me via phone</h2>

<p>First off, if you’re not willing to put something in writing, then that itself raises a red flag and makes me more likely to dismiss you.</p>

<p>Second, phone calls &mdash; particularly unexpected/unsolicited ones &mdash; are intrinsically intrusive. Additionally, developers typically run on what can be described as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">the maker’s schedule</a>, and I’m not exception. By calling me, you’ve diverted my attention from my work, broken my concentration. <em>The phone call itself does this, even if I don’t answer.</em> At the very least, your call has just cost me <a href="http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/">roughly 10-15 minutes</a> in productivity. Since time is money, you then owe me a fancy coffee at a hipster coffee shop, just for the interruption. If I actually answer and talk to you, you might as well buy me lunch.</p>

<p>In fact, if you’re really interested in <em>me</em> and talking to me, then do that &mdash; buy me lunch. We can organize a lunch meeting via email (when I can respond at a time that suits me), and chat about things then. And keep in mind, it’s not about the free food aspect. It’s about respecting and valuing my time.</p>

<h2>Communicate with your other branches and don’t spam and harass me</h2>

<p>A one point earlier this year, I received <strong>5 emails and 3 phone calls from different people at different branches of the same recruiting company in the span of 2 weeks.</strong> Two weeks! Even worse? Nearly half of those came <em>after I asked them to remove me from their system</em> (for the third time, no less).</p>

<p><em>That</em> will get you reported to the Better Business Bureau, and you <em>will</em> be made known to my network as someone to not work with. Developers talk. Our industry may be huge, but our community is quite small. I can’t tell you the number of people I’ve found that I’ve crossed paths with in one way or another or found that my friends have shared connections beyond casual “friend” or “connection” gathering on social media networks. Earning yourself a place on my blacklist will very likely earn yourself a place on the blacklist of a few dozen other developers (conversely &mdash; earning a place of respect with me will make it more likely to get referrals from me).</p>

<p>I understand that there aren’t really any convenient times during which you can call, but that makes it even <em>more</em> important to not spam or harass me.</p>

<h2>Don’t send me leads in other cities</h2>

<p>Unless I’ve indicated a willingness to relocate (even better, a willingness to relocate to <em>that</em> city), or the company genuinely supports remote working (not just kind of puts up with it), I’m very, very likely not interested in it. Additionally, even if I am interested or would consider it, absence of a relocation package will pretty much guarantee I’ll ignore it. Selling a house and moving a family is a pain in the ass, so there’s a <em>lot</em> of inertia there.</p>

<h1>What I want in a job</h1>

<p>Now that you’ve read this far, let’s look at the things that I want in a job. I’m in a good position right now and am not specifically looking to change. Therefore, while I always keep my ear to the ground, I can afford to be ultra-picky. Odds are very, very good, then, that I will ignore any lead that doesn’t match up with the following things.</p>

<p>These are not the demands of an entitled young worker. These are things that I’ve found work best for me and allow me to be a better employee to an employer. These are also things that I’ve found that say a lot about the quality of the environment. In other words, the more of these qualities that a company fulfills, the more likely I’ll be a good match for the company (not just the position itself).</p>

<h2>Only agencies that truly value their developers</h2>

<p>This really applies to all companies, but from the experiences I’ve had at the ones I worked at suggest that agencies are some of the worst offenders. When the people in an environment that’s proven toxic for me repeatedly tell me that that company is better than the other (big player) agencies that they’ve worked at, that sends a pretty clear message that I want nothing to do with the entire lot.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in agency environments, and they were all a big fail to me. The worst fail was with a company that touted great culture, but it was lip service and superficial things &mdash; the pool table, ping pong table, and video games that I’d seen used a collective less than half a dozen times in the year and a half I was there; the happy hours and parties that were as much a disturbance to us as good things. The things that really matter to good culture &mdash; not overloading us with work, providing us with quiet environments, and the ability of project and account managers to reign in a client and say “no” once in a while (especially when the client expects it without paying extra or adjusting the deadline) &mdash; are what I’m interested in. Without these things, I crash and burn, and such an environment is a toxic one for me.</p>

<h3>Brownie points: encourage self-direction of projects and full project ownership</h3>

<p>I’m a big fan of Zack Holman’s articles on some of GitHub’s ideals. In this case, it’s <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-creativity/">his “Creativity Means Self-Direction” section of this one</a>. This isn’t a deal-breaking ideal, but the company that does this would be worth its weight in gold, particularly on top of fulfilling the other ideals. I would love to be able to work on the project(s) that I choose to work on, and be able to take full ownership and have a certain amount of control/authority over that project, and tinker it to improve it as I see fit.</p>

<h2>Remote work friendly</h2>

<p>I have found that a company’s view on people working remotely has been a fairly accurate barometer for other environmental mindsets.</p>

<p>My ideal is the option to work full time remotely. <strong>My line of work does not require physical presence in a specific location.</strong> Many of the best teams in my industry are comprised of people who have never met in person. It most certainly can be done successfully, given the right infrastructure.</p>

<p>I may consider a position that allows it on a regular part time basis. <em>This does not mean “you can work from home if you’re snowed in…”</em> but rather, I have the option to, say, work from home on Wednesdays, because those are my most productive days, and I can encourage that productivity by working in an environment that I’ve set up to be ideal for me and don’t have to worry about people walking up to me and interrupting me while I’m in the zone.</p>

<h2>Results-only work environment</h2>

<p>If you don’t know what this is, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-12-10/smashing-the-clock">here’s some required reading for you</a>, and when you’re done with that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842921/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591842921&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=graywolfweb-20&amp;linkId=PBMFRAJ3BFUSYUQ6">pick up <em>Why Work Sucks And How To Fix It</em> and read it</a> . I’ll wait.</p>

<p>Done with your homework? Good, because this one’s come to be a deal-breaker for me.</p>

<p>In the US, developers are nearly always exempt salary (thank you “Fair” Labor Standards Act…), and most employers are too hung up on number of hours worked. This is <em>a very bad combination,</em> because it is very easily abused to get what amounts to free labor. <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/">Developers are creative people, with peaks and troughs of productivity.</a> It does a disservice to both us and our employers if we’re not able to honor those troughs by doing something else in our lives that can break us out of these non-productive phases, especially during slow times in the company. Requiring me to work a particular number of hours a day or week, even when there’s no or not much work to do, is not “hour flexibility,” nor is it “work life balance” (especially if I’m required to use accumulated paid time off of any sort if I don’t work those hours). If I’m salaried, you’re paying me for the value I bring to the company, not for my time. If you’re going to hold me to a time clock, pay me proper overtime pay. I’m a professional level employee with an advanced set of skills, not a slave.</p>

<p>In short, <strong>I am much more willing to work overtime when needed if I know that I don’t have to work a “regular” number of hours during the next slow period.</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, a ROWE discourages office politics. I <em>despise</em> office politics and don’t do well with them (for reasons I’ve explained elsewhere on my blog). So, a ROWE is more likely to be a workplace that’s friendlier to my personality, making it that much more likely that my relationship with the company will be a long and happy one.</p>

<h2>Brownie points: use modern tools and technologies</h2>

<p>This isn’t a deal-breaking thing, but it is an ideal. Simply put, I’m able to do more and be more productive when I’m able to work with modern tools, instead of trying to fight with a legacy system that doesn’t follow any standards (unless I’m modernizing said legacy system).</p>

<h1>Phew! You made it!</h1>

<p>Read all the way through that and still have something for me? Awesome! Send it my way, being mindful of the things we talked about here.</p>

    <id>http://ShaunaGordon.com/blog/2014/08/19/youre-not-alone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.</p>

<p>Then I met <a href="http://baugues.com/">Greg Baugues</a>.</p>

<p>Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about <a href="http://userscape.com/laracon/2014/gregbaugues.html">the talk I attended at Laracon</a>, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.</p>

<p>If you ever have the opportunity, attend this man’s talk. Even if you’ve seen the videos of it.</p>

<p>He’s the driving force behind this entry. Until now, I’ve kept my professional image away from my more personal parts. I’ve compartmentalized my identity, basically. Tech and business here, mental and physical health over there, homesteading over there (insert gestures to different directions here). But the truth is, my having Autism and Depression are part of what shapes me as a person and affects my professional life, whether I want them to or not. And just like I have started looking up to Greg as a role model for someone who has seen success with his ADHD and Bipolar out in the open, the others out there need more people to look up to, as well. We all need people to understand us and our differences, so that they can see us as strengths to be embraced, instead of liabilities to be feared. And, as Robin Williams’ death has shown so vividly, we need to be able to talk about these things openly and not be ashamed of them.</p>

<h2>I Am Autistic</h2>

<p>My official diagnosis is actually Asperger’s Syndrome, but as of the release of the DSM-V in May 2013, that got rolled into the “official” Autism name. It never really wasn’t part of the Autism Spectrum, but now it just goes by the name High Functioning Autism. Either way, it means that I can blend in with others most of the time, but still relate better to the little boy who freaks out at the crying baby, runs to a corner, and starts rocking back and forth.</p>

<p>In his talk, Greg brought up the “Hunter-Farmer hypothesis,” which is commonly used to explain the origin of ADHD. It’s an interesting theory that basically states that such differences in neurological functioning were not only beneficial, but arguably <em>essential</em> when we were hunter-gatherers, but that since we settled down and started farming, those differences started becoming maladaptive. Those with ADHD now would have been the hunters then, with laser focus under pressure, and bursts of high activity. They may have even been able to “fly under the radar” for generations as soldiers, which experience the same kind of peak and trough routine (or as Greg put it, “War has been described as long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.”), and it’s only very recently, when we’ve all been forced to sit still for hours on end from the time we’re five years old, that it’s become a problem, and since it started becoming a problem, it has exploded in our faces.</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>There is a hypthesis that parallels ADHD-as-hunter, known as the <a href="http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/EP09207238.pdf">Solitary Forager Hypthesis</a>. In it, Jared Reser explores the idea that some of the common symptoms of Autism &mdash; repetition, rote memorization, obsession over things modern society deems trivial &mdash; may have been highly beneficial traits in hunter-gatherer times. Additionally, the Autistic’s ability to work alone and not be wholly dependent on social groups may have been advantageous, especially in tribes that lived in places where foraging took the individuals far and away from each other for great lengths of time. Like those with ADHD were probably able to find their niches until very recently, I think so did Autistics, in the form of artisans, scholars, and monks &mdash; who spent their entire lives replicating things, doing the same thing over and over, and meticulously honing their craft in a near-obsessive way, with some going so far as to not talk to others and taking a vow of silence.</p>

<p>Reser concludes with this, which I think is a phenomenal philosophy for not just Autism, but ADHD and several other neuro-atypical states:</p>

<h2>I Also Have Depression</h2>

<p>The outpouring of awareness support for mental illness in the wake of Robin Williams' death has sparked a rise, especially in the developer community, of efforts to end the stigma around mental illness, so that those with them don’t feel ashamed to seek help. I am no exception for either giving or needing to receive that support, and I hope this marks a more permanent rise in such movements than what past losses have seen.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS) after a late-term miscarriage that, for all intents and purposes, shattered every fiber of my being. That event not only turned me into a vastly different (and unfortunately, more fragile) person, but it exacerbated what was already there.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that I’ve suffered from Depression to one degree or another for about as long as I can remember. Whether it was slowly ingrained into me by a life surrounded by abusive people, both peers and those in positions of authority, or if it was there first and just painted a target on my back for those people, I don’t know. Frankly, it doesn’t matter anymore.</p>

<p>Even when I was younger, the thought of suicide had crossed my mind on more than one occasion, and in recent years, such thoughts have increased in frequency, though I’ve always been too selfless to actually go through with it, because I don’t want to upset my family, and don’t want to put the stress of things like a funeral and being a single father on my husband. It’s not that I think suicide is a “selfish” act &mdash; I don’t believe it is &mdash; but rather that I’m not a very selfish or self-serving person by nature. I’m driven to please others or feel “needed” or “useful.” Something like suicide is the polar opposite to that, and, therefore, takes a considerable amount of effort just to do it. It probably also helps that I end up over-thinking and, in a sense, “over-engineering” my way out of actually going through with it.</p>

<p>I mention the miscarriage, because that’s really also something else that needs to be talked about more. Did you know that the miscarriage rate is upwards of 50% of all pregnancies when chemical pregnancies and other very early miscarriages are taken into account? I didn’t know that, either, until 2006. Even excluding those, the miscarriage rate for Western society is still about 20%. In other words, for every 5 women you know, one of them will have miscarried a known pregnancy. Late term miscarriages &mdash; any that happen betmaween 12 and 24 weeks &mdash; have a rate of 1 in 100, and stillbirths &mdash; after 24 weeks &mdash; have a rate of 1 in 160. This means that odds are very good that you’ve met at least one woman who has lost a pregnancy. And yet, how many of us know the people that have suffered through this? This is why we need to talk more about it, especially since late term miscarriages and stillbirths are particularly devastating.</p>

<p>At that point, you’ve bonded with your unborn child. You’ve probably already had a baby shower. The nursery’s almost done, you’re part way through those birthing classes. You’ve seen the “big” ultrasound. And then, one day, everything grinds to a screeching, horrific, agonizing halt.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t end there, and this is one of those things that really no one talks about. For most sudden traumatic events, the actual event is over relatively quickly, and once it’s done, you can focus on healing, possibly with the help of painkillers. It doesn’t work that way for a woman that experiences a late-term loss, because the body still goes through the postnatal motions <em>as though nothing bad has happened.</em> This includes lactating. The worst pain in the world &mdash; producing milk for an infant that isn’t there &mdash; there are no painkillers for that two weeks of hell.</p>

<p>Yes, this was very much my breaking point, and the best image I have for it is quite literally a glass item dropping and shattering into a few million pieces. It’s a shame <em>Eragon</em> the movie didn’t hold true to the books, or the shattering of the Star Sapphire at the Battle of Farthen Dur would have been a perfect image for those who haven’t gone through such a loss (as it stands, it’s still a perfect metaphor). Unfortunately, unlike the dwarves in <em>Eragon</em>, we don’t have dragon magic to restore us to our former glory, even if we and our fleet of people dedicated to piecing us back together could manage to do so.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://medium.com/@kayladnls/youre-not-alone-f210b82893cb">a good friend of mine, Kayla,</a> related, there are a number of times where I’ve sat alone and cried, or cried myself to sleep. Sometimes, there may be a trigger &mdash; not a reason, per se, but rather, something that starts the chain reaction. Maybe it’s a bad day at work, a fight with my husband, or my mind replaying real or imagined horrors. Other times, there’s no known reason at all, just the nothingness itself weighing down on me.</p>

<h2>I’m Not Alone</h2>

<p><a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html">Wired Magazine</a> nailed it way back in 2004: the stereotypical “geek” is more likely to be on the Autism Spectrum (and therefore have kids who are also on the Spectrum). And it’s true, computers and electronics, and the professional fields that revolve around them, attract people with varying levels of Autism. I suspect that it largely has to do with the fact that technology itself (and math in general) is based on clear-cut rules and standards, and those rules and standards usually have a reason behind them. There may be a hundred ways to solve a problem, but all of those ways still require laying out a set of rules to achieve an end. Technology <em>makes sense</em> in a world that is otherwise run by arbitrary nonsense to us. So, if you work in, or in any way interact with people who work in, technology, odds are, you’ve met someone with Autism, even if you didn’t realize it.</p>

<p>Even if you aren’t involved at all with anything technology-related, with the Autism diagnostic rate somewhere between 1 in 50 and 1 in 68 (depending on who you ask), odds are, you’ve met someone with Autism. And since not everyone with Autism gravitates toward technology, it may even be that new artist you saw at your local gallery, or the odd neighbor kid.</p>

<h2>What Does It All Mean?</h2>

<p>For me, it means I’ve got a witty, no-holds-barred, sarcastic, confident woman trapped inside a fearful, anxiety-filled body and brain. I can’t count the number of times I’ve imagined a conversation &mdash; any conversation &mdash; where I’d be able to make some kind of witty response, or even just stand up for myself without shutting down, and actually succeed at doing so.</p>

<p>I’ve had a running theory that Autism is largely and input/output disorder &mdash; the common threads in nearly all Autistics is difficulty processing input (sensory overload, slow auditory processing, etc), and difficulty turning it into output (difficulty with spoken conversation, not showing emotion, etc). As such, there are a number of myths that have formed, as researchers and doctors try to make sense of Autism and help people with it. I’ll go into detail another time, as there’s a lot to be said on the matter, but I’ll touch on some of the things in a moment.</p>

<p>My personal history with both Autism and Depression have made me a very self-aware kind of person. This is very much a double-edge sword, because I can see where failure points are, but don’t always have the knowledge or means of <em>correcting</em> said failure points. In other words, I can see <em>that</em> something is failing (usually communication), but I can’t figure out <em>why</em> or what to do about it or even to mitigate the resulting issues. This occasionally leads to a negative feedback loop, where the Depression starts to take over in the form of despair for being able to get things right.</p>

<h3>Okay, But What Does It <em>Mean</em>?</h3>

<p>Waxing philosophical about the ups and downs of both matters is a great pass time, but what does it mean for those around me, in day-to-day interactions?</p>

<p>Well, first, let me address some misconceptions of primarily Autism, and to a lesser extent, Depression:</p>

<ul>
<li>It <strong>does not</strong> mean that I am violent, prone to violence, or will become a serial killer (or any other form of murderer).</li>
<li>It <strong>does not</strong> mean that I am mentally disabled.</li>
<li>It <strong>does not</strong> mean that I lack empathy or have no feelings, though I may feel and express them differently from other people.</li>
<li>It <strong>does not</strong> mean that my Autism in need of a “cure,” or that I otherwise need “fixed.” My Depression may be a mental illness, but my Autism is not, and there is a difference.</li>
<li>It <strong>does not</strong> mean that I’m constantly under suicide watch or that I’d do something drastic just because someone said something I didn’t like.</li>
<li><p>If I happen to be on antidepressants at the time, it <strong>does not</strong> mean that I have to be happy all the time, or that the medication is not working if I show even the slightest hint of a negative emotion.</p></li>
<li><p>It <strong>does</strong> mean that I communicate better through asynchronous means (writing, as opposed to speaking), for a multitude of reasons.</p></li>
<li>It <strong>does</strong> mean that sometimes I will get overstressed and need to remove myself from the situation, and that when that happens, I need enough respect and compassion from others to give me some space and time.</li>
<li>It <strong>does</strong> mean that I do better knowing things ahead of time, such as changes in schedules or meeting agendas (especially when said meeting is prone to be emotionally charged or critical of me/my work).</li>
<li>It <strong>does</strong> mean that, particularly when it comes to social infractions, I genuinely may not know what has upset someone, and telling me “you’re smart, you can figure it out,” does not help me.</li>
<li>It <strong>does</strong> mean that I will <em>always</em> prioritize the things that help me <em>above all else</em>. This includes proper diet and exercise, and the means and time to achieve those. This also means that I am <em>very protective</em> of my work-life balance, and will strive to ensure that I’m not working more than I can handle. My ability to stop working at a reasonable hour so that I can participate in that day’s workout and cook my dinner as opposed to ordering pizza and soda is what allows me to be productive each day and keep working on the things that make my employer money. No job is worth my well-being, especially since sacrificing the latter will inevitably sacrifice the former.</li>

<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>

<h3>Recognize That Not Everyone Who Is Sick Looks So</h3>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Twerkerella/status/501230591615201281/photo/1">This image illustrates the problem quite well</a>, as does <a href="http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">this story</a>, for those more inclined for words.</p>

<p>If you do not suffer from an invisible illness, recognize that just because you can’t <em>see</em> the symptoms, it doesn’t mean they’re not there. They are very much there, very much real, and those of us with them spend every waking moment doing what we can to keep it from consuming us and our lives. For some of us, the very act of getting out of bed is little short of a miracle. What you see is generally an act or part of a plan to get through the day and meet such needs as earning money.</p>

<p>We’re not being lazy or making excuses when we say we can’t do something. Do you say that a paraplegic is just being lazy by not walking, or a blind person just isn’t trying hard enough at seeing? No? The same applies to mental illness. A person suffering from Depression can’t just “try harder” at being happy. It doesn’t work that way.</p>

<h3>Provide Reasonable Work Hours and Conditions</h3>

<p>If you’re an employer, especially in the tech industry, remember that not everyone is a healthy, single, 20-something who has no life outside of working for you, and that <em>this is not a bad thing.</em> Different people bring different experiences and knowledge to the table, providing valuable input.</p>

<p>Instead of viewing these things as liabilities, view them as assets to be cultivated and nurtured. Really, all people should be treated this way, as no one should have to work ungodly numbers of hours every day. That’s a sure path to destruction of even the healthiest of individuals, though it may take longer.</p>

<p>For those with mental illnesses, it’s better to be able to work shorter hours, which keeps us from long-term destruction, than to run us ragged and destroy us in a few months or, at best, a couple of years. It’s been shown that <em>everyone</em> &mdash; with or without any kind of chronic illness &mdash; does better on shorter hours and that long hours are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/09/news/economy/shorter-work-week/">at best useless and at worst counterproductive</a>. There’s a reason labor laws are supposed to limit workers to 40 hours a week (“exempt” status notwithstanding), and those reasons don’t just apply to the blue collar workers for whom such laws are actually enforced.</p>

<h3>Talk</h3>

<p>For those of us with mental illnesses, we can start by talking about it. There are a couple of hashtags floating around Twitter. The main one is <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23endthestigma&amp;src=tyah">#EndTheStigma</a>, which includes not just mental health, but other stigmatized things as well. There’s also a new one rising up, called <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hackthestigma&amp;src=typd">#HackTheStigma</a>, that was originally created due to not wanting to be associated with the “End The Stigma” campaigns used by some companies.</p>

<p>Even if you’re not ready to talk openly, you can reach out to me or any of the others in the community that have opened their inboxes and/or phones.</p>

<p>We’re here. You’re not alone.</p>

<p>We've all been there -- the peon, low-level, replaceable employee at the bottom of the corporate food chain. Unfortunately, since we can't all be wildly successful business owners, or get promoted to management almost immediately, we sometimes have to do what we can in our little peon positions. It's heartening, then, to find <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Change-Diary/">James Shore's Change Diary</a>, via <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/changing-your-organization-for-peons.html">Jeff Atwood's blog</a>, from when James was working as a developer shortly after the DotCom bust. </p><p>It's a long read, and I haven't quite gotten all the way through it, but even what I've read so far has made it well worth the read. There's success, there's failure, but most of all, there's proof that even one peon can make a difference in a company. It's a lesson that employees and managers alike would do well to learn, I think. </p></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Currently, here in Columbus, the trend in employing web developers is to hire independent contractors. In many cases, they're "contract to hire," where the idea is that the employee would work on a contract basis for the first couple of months, then be hired for full benefits after this "trial period." In some of those cases, that "trial" period never actually ends, and the employee is expected to show up to work every day and not receive the full benefits of employment. This practice, however, isn't necessary legal. Whether you're a contractor or an employer, you should know where that line is between contractor and employee.</p><!-- more --><h2>The Law</h2><p>The IRS has a law that details particular qualifications that determine whether a person is an employee or independent contractor. According to <a title="Findlaw - Employee or Contractor?" href="http://library.findlaw.com/2000/Feb/1/127759.html">Findlaw</a>, there are twenty factors that determine whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor.</p><p>These factors include:</p><ul><li>Level of Instruction</li><li>Training</li><li>Degree of business integration</li><li>Extent of personal services</li><li>Continuity of relationship</li><li>Flexibility of schedule</li><li>Demands for full-time work</li><li>Need for on-site services</li><li>Sequence of work</li><li>Requirements for reports</li><li>Method of payment</li><li>Payment of business or travel expenses</li><li>Provision of tools and materials</li><li>Investment in facilities</li><li>Realization of profit or loss</li><li>Work for multiple companies</li><li>Availablity to the public</li><li>Control over discharge</li><li>Right of termination</li></ul><p>These factors are considered on a whole, with some factors holding more weight than others, to determine whether a person is a contractor or an employee. Utimately, it comes down to who has control over when, where, and how a person's work is done. If the employer has most or all of the control, then the worker is a de facto employee. If not, then the worker is an independent contractor.</p><h2>The Implications</h2><p>What this law means is that employers should be careful about how they use their contractors. Likewise, workers should be aware of what their rights are. If the IRS gets involved and reclassifies contract workers as employees, employers owe the IRS the back taxes for the length of time determined, and then have to provide the workers with the benefits of employees if the company continues to use their services.</p><p>Microsoft learned this the hard way in the late 1980s. They had hired a large number of "independent contractors" that were assimilated into the teams, were required to work at the offices during the company's hours, and used the company's equipment. The IRS determined that the "freelancers" were actually employees, and Microsoft paid the back taxes for the previous two years of the workers' employment.</p><h2>Contractors</h2><p>If you're a contractor, keep an eye on what your employer is asking you to do, particularly if you have an ongoing relationship with them. Your ability to work for multiple, even competing companies, as well as your ability to choose when and where to work, are some of the heavier-weighted factors in whether or not you're a de facto employee.</p><p>Be nice to your employer, particularly if the company isn't a behemoth like Microsoft or Nationwide Insurance (another company that got in trouble with de facto employees). The law is somewhat obscure to those that aren't lawyers, and can be hard to find within the labyrinth of federal statutes, so it's entirely possible that a smaller company, which generally lacks an on-staff lawyer to guide their decisions, simply might not know about the law. If that's the case, it would likely be easier to swallow the recommendation for change if it came from a worker, than if it came from the IRS and with a mandate to pay back taxes for the contractors.</p></div>

There's no way you'll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there. "So nice of you to join us this morning," he greets you, a "do it again and you're fired" look on his face. You sit down at your desk, still a little too agitated to start work quite yet, so you read your favorite news site for ten minutes. Part of you resigns to this life, believing it's the way things are, and nothing will change, but another part of you feels that there must be a better way.</p><!-- more --><p>That second part is right. There is a better way.</p><p>Former Best Buy employees Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson (now owners of <a href="http://gorowe.com">CultureRx</a>) share their experience of transforming Best Buy's corporate culture from the traditional clock-watching to a Results-Only Work Environment, or ROWE, and how ROWE can work for other companies.  The idea seems counterintuitive, at first, especially to those entrenched in traditional corporate culture and politics, but as Cali and Jody start breaking down the obstacles and overcoming objections, the idea starts to make sense. Give people control over their time, allow them to work when and where they're most productive, and grade them on their results, and instead of slacking and decreased productivity, they'll reward the company with increased performance, increased satisfaction, and lower voluntary turnover.</p><p>Why is it that the results seem counter to what managers fear? Because it's what everyone already does...just not at work. When we do our household work, we don't deal with politics, we don't "look like" we're doing something, we <em>are</em> doing things. We "grade" ourselves on whether the work gets done or not. The laundry either gets washed or put away, or it doesn't. The dishes make it into the dishwasher or they don't. We do all this stuff on the weekends or after work and don't really think about it, nor do we really get burnt out from doing the usual "home-life" stuff we need to do on a regular basis, and we can do this because we have control over our time, so we can use it as we see fit. This doesn't happen at work, because at work, we're not in control of our time. If we get done with our work without filling up our required 40 hours, then we either have to find more work to do, or we have to look busy. Going home and enjoying the rest of the day or week is out of the question.</p><p><em>Why Work Sucks</em> goes into detail about this problem, known as <a href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/manage/presenteeism.htm">presenteeism</a>, and how costly it is to companies. When an employee has a set amount of work and has to fill a 40-hour week with it, there's no incentive to work efficiently beyond keeping it from taking more than 40 hours (and even that upper limit is questionable).  The book also addresses the underhanded comments, such as "nice of you to join us," which it calls "Sludge." It explains that while on the surface and on an individual basis, these comments seem harmless, but not only do they add up, they are also designed to keep us "in line" with the corporate culture of clock watching.</p><p>Think about it, how often have you or someone you know called in sick, just so you didn't have to explain to your boss about the accident on your primary route? Or how about making a "socially acceptable" excuse because you had a hard time sleeping the night before and didn't want to get out of bed? Or any other number of stories you've lined up to tell your boss or coworkers for whatever reason why you were late coming in or early to leave or didn't make it in at all? How often have you feared that you'd be looked down on even if your real reason <em>is</em> a "socially acceptable" reason for missing or shortening your day? How many times have you come into work sick, or felt guilty about staying home when sick? These are all a result of Sludge and the corporate clock-watching culture.</p><p>ROWE, however, asks "why does the clock matter so much? The work itself is what matters," and that's the basis for ROWE &mdash; it doesn't matter how, when, or where the work gets done, as long as it <em>gets done</em> (assuming, of course, the means are legal and the work is done before any applicable deadlines). Does it really matter if Sally chooses to do her work in a coffee shop from 5pm to 2am, or that Dave does his from 6am to 11am at home, then some more from 3pm to 6pm at the park? If the work is getting done and is up to standards, then the answer is simple, it <em>doesn't</em> matter.</p><p>One of the best parts about the ROWE concept is that it's not just theory, it's in practice in Fortune 500 and Fortune 100 companies, as well as others. ROWE is already working for these companies, and these success stories provide leverage for implementing the system in even more companies. Taking a more creative look at the concept, on an individual level, working in a ROWE is not unlike working as a freelancer, except that a ROWE employee has the stability of an established company.</p><p>In all, <em>Work Sucks</em> is a must-read for anyone who knows that there must be a better way, as well as those who feel that the way things are is good enough (in other words, everyone in any kind of corporate environment). Even if your company can't fully implement a true ROWE, it can probably make use of a lot of the advice it offers.</p></div>
