  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I know. It seems like I&rsquo;ve changed blog platforms on an annual basis. With a little luck, this will be the last time.</p>

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>In short, I became disillusioned with Blogger. It seemed like a nice platform, at first, but I soon came to find the cracks in the foundation. So, after some thought about what I <em>really</em> want/need in a blog platform, I decided to go a different direction.</p>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t use instant messenger of some form these days? Those of us from the days when there were as many chat programs as people probably have half a dozen accounts or more, or at least did at one point (who didn&#8217;t have ICQ, MSN, AIM, <i>and</i> Yahoo?). Thank goodness for unifying applications like Pidgin/Adium, Trillian, and others.</p><p>Now that some of us old chatters have grown up and created businesses (or at least business names) of our own, we may need to add our Google Apps accounts to the mix. This is a little trickier than just adding a Gmail, or other established provider, account, but thankfully, it&#8217;s not that difficult. I found, though, that start-to-finish instructions for getting set up on Pidgin were lacking, so we&#8217;ll cover them here. These instructions will work for Pidgin, and should work for Adium (the Mac port of Pidgin), though one may find the settings in slightly different places, due to convention differences across the platforms. The basic information should also work for other clients, such as Tillian, though, obviously, you&#8217;re on your own for finding were to enter everything.</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;m terrible about coming up with projects to do to learn a new language. As such, I generally pick them up as jobs require them. This makes it difficult to find a good reason to pick up a new language for me. So, when I made the decision earlier this week to learn Python, I decided to go a slightly different route - Gedit plugin development!</p> </div>

<p>We&#8217;ve all been there &#8211; the peon, low-level, replaceable employee at the bottom of the corporate food chain. Unfortunately, since we can&#8217;t all be wildly successful business owners, or get promoted to management almost immediately, we sometimes have to do what we can in our little peon positions. It&#8217;s heartening, then, to find <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Change-Diary/">James Shore&#8217;s Change Diary</a>, via <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/changing-your-organization-for-peons.html">Jeff Atwood&#8217;s blog</a>, from when James was working as a developer shortly after the DotCom bust. </p><p>It&#8217;s a long read, and I haven&#8217;t quite gotten all the way through it, but even what I&#8217;ve read so far has made it well worth the read. There&#8217;s success, there&#8217;s failure, but most of all, there&#8217;s proof that even one peon can make a difference in a company. It&#8217;s a lesson that employees and managers alike would do well to learn, I think. </p></div>

<p>Those who know me know that I&#8217;m a Linux fan (and a fan of Open Source software in general), so it&#8217;s probably no surprise that I run a version of Linux on at least my personal computers. In fact, being a PHP developer lends itself very well to using Linux on my work computers, too. Previously, I used Ubuntu, a popular Debian-based version. I still would recommend Ubuntu to those looking to get their feet wet with Linux, but my own path and workflow needs took me away from it with their recent change to a user interface they call &#8220;Unity&#8221;. I found the Mac-like Unity interface to be too hostile to my dual monitor setup, and at the time, Gnome 3 on it wasn&#8217;t very stable, and I didn&#8217;t really care for the other desktop UIs that are available. Since I actually liked Gnome 3, I decided to try a distribution that has it integrated. I was already somewhat familiar with the Red Hat family of operating systems from dabbling with it back before Red Hat proper became an enterprise solution, so Fedora (often referred to as Red Hat&#8217;s testing ground) seemed like an obvious choice.</p></div>

<h2>Why the new home?</h2><p>SilverStripe is great, but, like the rest of the platform, there&#8217;s not much to it. This isn&#8217;t bad in and of itself, I just don&#8217;t have time to essentially build and maintain the workings of a blog. So, I&#8217;ve decided to basically outsource that aspect, so that I can focus on the content of my blog, and the core of my website (which, admittedly, has been sorely neglected).</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Jeremy Clarke made a nice, sleek theme/template set for Munin (see his <a href="http://simianuprising.com/2011/02/19/raven-my-custom-theme-templates-for-munin/" target="_blank">original post</a> about it). Since, like him, I hate the default theme (it&#8217;s ugly, and done in 90s style table layout), I wanted to change it, but I currently don&#8217;t have the time to write my own theme (not that there&#8217;s much documentation on the topic, despite how awesome Munin actually is). Jeremy&#8217;s seems to be the only one on the entire Internet aside from the default and default-alt themes, and he did a great job with what he had. However, I had some issues getting it working on the version I&#8217;m running (1.4.4). It was mainly just missing files (kinda-sorta-not really his fault, Munin should probably just ignore things like missing images and allow the page to break, instead of halting copying the files to the html directory).</p><p>Anywho, so I grabbed the copy by Kim (in the comments), who was kind enough to update the theme for 1.4.* (it was originally for 1.3.*), but her copy didn&#8217;t have the required files, either. So, I got it working in my test environment and then updated the template folder with the necessary files. I&#8217;m posting it here for easy downloading.</p><p><a title="Raven theme GitHub project" href="https://github.com/ShaunaGordon/raven-munin-theme">Download Raven Munin theme.</a></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Currently, here in Columbus, the trend in employing web developers is to hire independent contractors. In many cases, they&#8217;re &#8220;contract to hire,&#8221; where the idea is that the employee would work on a contract basis for the first couple of months, then be hired for full benefits after this &#8220;trial period.&#8221; In some of those cases, that &#8220;trial&#8221; period never actually ends, and the employee is expected to show up to work every day and not receive the full benefits of employment. This practice, however, isn&#8217;t necessary legal. Whether you&#8217;re a contractor or an employer, you should know where that line is between contractor and employee.</p></div>
