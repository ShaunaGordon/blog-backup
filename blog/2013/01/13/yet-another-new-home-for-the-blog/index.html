<div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I know. It seems like I&rsquo;ve changed blog platforms on an annual basis. With a little luck, this will be the last time.</p>

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>In short, I became disillusioned with Blogger. It seemed like a nice platform, at first, but I soon came to find the cracks in the foundation. So, after some thought about what I <em>really</em> want/need in a blog platform, I decided to go a different direction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Problems With Blogger (and the Other Big Platforms)</h2>

<p>Blog platforms are great for the people who don&rsquo;t know any better, but I&rsquo;m a web developer. Not only do I get the&hellip;ahem&hellip;<em>joy</em> of seeing how the sausage is made on platforms like Wordpress, where I can look at the source code itself and even have to modify it through extensions, but I also get glimpses of that process in platforms where I&rsquo;m not privy to the source code, such as Blogger.</p>

<p>One of the first problems I ran into was the HTML that Blogger outputs in posts. It seems that Blogger was written back when Geocities was still popular, and people didn&rsquo;t care about semantic HTML, and Google doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about updating it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to control the style of text that isn&rsquo;t inside any kind of predictable tag block. It&rsquo;s also difficult to deal with code that&rsquo;s filled with &lt;div&gt;s that are nested twelve deep.</p>

<p>The other big problem I found was the editor. I hate the standard WYSIWYG editors, in part because I spend most of my time typing in some form of code or markup. That said, wrapping everything in &lt;p&gt; tags gets tedious, so my favorite editor for blogging is one that will deal with that tedium, while allowing me to add HTML as needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not just use Wordpress? It wraps everything in &lt;p&gt; tags!&rdquo; Yeah&hellip;it does a &ldquo;wrap the world&rdquo; thing. Instead of wrapping the text as it&rsquo;s being written, or even wrapping it on save, it does it only on <em>output</em>. Dynamically, which means it&rsquo;s an extra output step, which seems unnecessary to me. Additionally (and here&rsquo;s where the &ldquo;wrap the world!&rdquo; part comes in), it doesn&rsquo;t care what it wraps. Therefore, it wraps, say, images in their own paragraphs, or even in with a neighboring paragraph. Wordpress&rsquo;s editor also drives me insane with what it does and does not allow. Even the little bit I&rsquo;ve worked with it for client projects, I&rsquo;ve wanted to throw it out a window, due to the way the content editor tries to dictate what I can and can&rsquo;t post.</p>

<p>To Blogger&rsquo;s credit, its editor doesn&rsquo;t do what Wordpress does. On the other hand, it takes the completely opposite approach &ndash; the HTML editor doesn&rsquo;t assume anything. This means that every single paragraph has to be wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags, by hand.</p>

<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be too big a deal, if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that I&rsquo;ve started posting from my mobile devices, which, of course, don&rsquo;t have great keyboards for typing HTML tags. That raises writing out the tags from mildly tedius to unacceptable. It also brings me to my next problem with Blogger.</p>

<p>The mobile app isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be. In fact, it kind of sucks. It&rsquo;s impossible to tell if it uses rich text or HTML mode. When you save a draft, it inserts HTML, but then encodes existing HTML. On a phone, there&rsquo;s also all of about three lines visible when the keyboard is active, thanks to all the chrome. In short, it&rsquo;s a mess.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with this crap. Time to move on to greener pastures.</p>

<h2>Enter Octopress (and Disqus)</h2>

<p>Followers of my G+ probably noticed that I voiced my issues and mind-leaks this past weekend. I enumerated the reasons for wanting a new blogging platform, which largely hasn&rsquo;t changed, except for wanting sane HTML output, and, ideally, to be able to write it in Markdown.</p>

<p>While searching, I also stumbled on an entirely different approach to writing blogs &ndash; static site generators. You see, with your typical blogs, the content is stored in a database, and is dynamically generated each time someone visits that URL. This is a terrific mechanism&hellip;for Amazon. For a blog? Not so much, if you really think about it. The content doesn&rsquo;t change <em>that</em> much, and, with the help of a tool, even the lists can be updated accordingly. Granted, for Joe Schmoe, who has a blog because his &ldquo;brother&rsquo;s kid is good with computers,&rdquo; something like Wordpress or Blogger or even Dreamwidth is good enough. For someone who lives in the world of code? I can find something better.</p>

<p>And it seems I may have.</p>

<p>I found Octopress, but didn&rsquo;t give it much stock at first. When I first found it, I was under the mistaken impression that you put the system on a server in much the same way you would with Wordpress. It also seemed like one of those blogs where you couldn&rsquo;t have comments. I wanted commenting, so I looked elsewhere.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled onto a blog that talked about migrating to Disqus and whatever their blog platform of choice ended up being. Now, I&rsquo;d seen Disqus around, and even commented using it, but never thought much of it. It&rsquo;s one of those things that you get so used to seeing that you no longer see it at all. What I found out while reading that blog was that not only could you add it to damn near anything, but you could migrate the comments, making it completely platform-agnostic. The fact that you can use the same Disqus login for any site that uses it is just icing on the cake. I was sold so quick that my Blogger blog already has it, so that I can migrate the comments over.</p>

<p>Once I did that, options opened up for blogging platforms, because then, the built in capabilities (or lack of capabilities) no longer mattered. I now have my threaded comments wherever I go. So, I ended up circling back to Octopress, thanks to finding it pretty much everywhere when searching for &ldquo;markdown blog&rdquo;. So, I dug some more into it, and the more I read about how it works, the more I liked it.</p>

<p>I found out that you don&rsquo;t actually set it up anywhere but on your working computer. It takes some command line, and the instructions are for Debian-based Linux distributions (including Ubuntu), but again, that&rsquo;s the world I live in, so no problem there. You then hook it up to a repository that&rsquo;s hosted somewhere, tell Octopress to generate everything, and upload the generated content.</p>

<p>Upload it where? Well, there are a number of places you could, but the most convenient I found was actually GitHub (factoid: it&rsquo;s named &ldquo;Octopress&rdquo;, because it runs off of GitHub&rsquo;s Jekyll static site generator, and GitHub&rsquo;s mascot is the &ldquo;Octo-cat&rdquo;). GitHub has a &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; feature that automatically renders HTML from a repository. So, what&rsquo;s uploaded to GitHub in my <a href="https://github.com/ShaunaGordon/shaunagordon.github.com">personal repository</a>, is actually <em>the</em> source for the rendered blog. How cool is that? Oh, and GitHub is nice and allows you to use your own domain, free of charge (because, really, it&rsquo;s stupid to charge to allow that kind of use; it&rsquo;s a setting in a text file).</p>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>Over the next&hellip;well, I don&rsquo;t know how long, I&rsquo;ll be working on migrating my Blogger over. Hopefully, the export feature is sane, and I&rsquo;ll be able to easily convert the HTML to Markdown, even if it means the third party tool. Then, I&rsquo;ll move my domain information over to it. I may even just move the rest of my site over, while I&rsquo;m at it, since I&rsquo;m already planning on reworking my site&rsquo;s design to be more mobile-friendly, and it&rsquo;s static and only a couple of pages, anyway. So, until then, I&rsquo;ll use the default Octopress theme for this blog. I&rsquo;ll have to see just how GitHub deals with more complex nameserver stuff.</p>

<p>Ah, the world of web development, ain&rsquo;t it grand?</p>
